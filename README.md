I don't fully remember but if you wanna run this I think you have to install the hot chocolate templates. Maybe they're just for project creation, idk.


`dotnet new install HotChocolate.Templates`

Launch app and access the Nitro website on this: http://localhost:5095/graphql

Nitro is a platform(?) you can use to view the queries/mutations. Feels kinda like an advanced version of swagger for graphql.
